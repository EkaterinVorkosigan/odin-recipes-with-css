        <li>2 garlic cloves, crushed</li>
        <li>2 tbsp medium curry paste (Madras is a good one to use)</li>
        <li>250g basmati rice, rinsed</li>
        <li>450ml vegetable stock</li>
        <li>400g can chickpeas, drained and rinsed</li>
        <li>handful of raisins</li>
        <li>175g frozen leaf spinach, thawed</li>
        <li>handful of cashew nuts</li>
        <li>natural yogurt to serve (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oil in a large non-stick pan that has a lid,
            then fry the garlic and curry paste over a medium 
            heat for 1 minute, until it's fragrant.
        </li>
        <li>Tip the rice into the pan with the stock, chickpeas
            and raisins and stir with a fork to stop the rice from
            clumping. Season with salt and pepper, then cover and 
            bring to the boil. Reduce to a medium heat and cook for
            12-15 minutes or until all the liquid has been absorbed
            and the rice is tender.
        </li>
        <li>Squeeze the excess water from the spinach with your
            hands. Tip it into the pan along with 2 tbsp of hot
            water and fluff up the rice with a fork, making sure
            the spinach is mixed in well. Toss in the cashews.
            Serve drizzled with natural yogurt if you like.
        </li>
    </ol>
