            <li>2 onions, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>2 heaped tbsp curry paste (we used Patak's Tikka Masala)</li>
            <li>400g can chopped tomatoes</li>
            <li>8 eggs</li>

            <li>4 tbsp Greek yogurt</li>
            <li>rice and mango chutney to serve</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the oil in a pan, then fry the onions over a low
                heat for 10 mins until golden. Add the curry paste and
                sizzle for 2 mins, stirring. Add the tomatoes and 200ml
                water, season to taste, then bring to the boil. Simmer
                for 10 mins until you have a rich sauce.
            </li>
            <li>Meanwhile, boil the eggs for 8 mins, cool in cold
                water, then peel and halve.
            </li>
            <li>Stir the peas and yogurt into the curry and simmer
                for another 2-3 mins. Put the eggs into the pan, 
                spoon the curry sauce over and leave for another 2
                mins to heat through. Serve with rice and mango
                chutney.
